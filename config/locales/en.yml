  rules_summary: "Summary of Rules"
  rules_view: "View full contest rules"
  rules_summary_body: |
    <p>The contest rules were designed to stimulate creativity and innovation, rather than constrain it. The contest is open to residents of the province of Ontario. City staff will be eligible to enter applications but will not be eligible for monetary prizes.</p>
    <p>Applicants may enter a software application designed for a mobile handheld device, desktop computer, website, or any other software platform broadly available to the residents of the City of Ottawa.</p>
    <p>While participants will be encouraged to use at least one data set from the City of Ottawa Open Data Catalogue, they do not have to. The aim of the contest is to generate improvements to the community through the use of applications that use publicly available data; as long as applicants build an application that will enhance the City of Ottawa, they may use any data that is publicly available.</p>
    <p>Ownership of software applications will remain with the developer of the application.</p>
    <p>All residents of Ontario over the age of 16 are eligible to enter the contest.</p>

    <p><em>Contest Rules Modified on December 29, 2010: See sections 3.1.1, 6.2.1, and 11.2.1</em></p>
    <h2>1. CONTEST PHASES:</h2>
    <p>1.1 The Apps4Ottawa Contest (“Contest”) is administered by the City of Ottawa (“City”) and consists of the following two phases collectively referred to as the "Contest Period":</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
    	<li>The first phase of the Contest begins at 5:00 p.m. EDT on September 29, 2010 and closes at 5:00 p.m. on January 3, 2011, the "Submission Period"); and</li>
    	<li>The second phase of the Contest begins at 5:00 p.m. EDT on January 4, 2011 and closes at 5:00 p.m. EDT on January 28, 2011 (the "Selection Period").</li>

Please ensure that your iPhone application is submitted to the Apple iPhone store well in advance of the contest deadline, as Apple generally delays the availability of submitted applications by one week or more. The City will not extend the contest deadline to accommodate any individual whose iPhone application has not been made public on the Apple iPhone store by the start of the selection period.</p>
    <p>4.5 You retain ownership of your Application and are permitted to sell the use of your Application commercially after the Contest Period if you choose to do so.</p>

    <p>4.7 Application Submissions containing any matter which in the sole discretion of the Panel is deemed as indecent, defamatory, offending, or demonstrates a lack of respect for public morals or conduct, or which adversely effects the public image or reputation of the City will not be accepted and disqualified.</p>

Application Ideas containing any matter which in the sole discretion of the City is deemed as indecent, defamatory, offending, or demonstrates a lack of respect for public morals or conduct, or which adversely effects the public image or reputation of the City will also be removed and disqualified.

The City will not be responsible, however, if factors beyond the City's reasonable control prevent prizes from being awarded. In any such event, no substitute prizes or cash equivalents will be provided. Prizes will only be delivered to the verified winner.</p>
    <p>6.2.1 Despite the reference in these Official Rules to the City awarding cash prizes to verified prize winners, and in particular the stipulation in section 6.2 that “prizes will only be delivered to the verified winner”, cash prizes won by an individual aged 16 or 17 will be awarded only in the name of his or her parent or legal guardian on behalf of the prize winner.</p>
    <p>6.3 The City reserves the right not to award prizes, or to award only some of the prizes, if there are not a sufficient number of eligible Contest entries, or if, for any other reason, there is a not a sufficient number of individuals to whom the prizes can be awarded. The City also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to select an alternate Contest winner from the eligible entries should any selected individual be unable or unwilling to comply with these Official Rules, or otherwise unable or unwilling to accept the offered prize.</p>
