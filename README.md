# Description

This application was used in the first Apps4Ottawa contest held in 2010/2011.  It provided a site that allowed users to submit applications to be voted on as well as ideas.  Work is currently underway to upgrade the site for future contests.

The intention of posting this code is for others to improve the application and provide those improvements back to the community by posting those updates here.

This code is provided as-is and with no warranties.  All references to the City of Ottawa found within the application, e.g. the "Apps4Ottawa" branding and associated word marks should be removed when publishing the site publicly.
