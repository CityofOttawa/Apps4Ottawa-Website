# Description

The base application was provided by the City of Edmonton (created for Apps4Edmonton) for use by the City of Ottawa for its first Apps4Ottawa contest held in 2010/2011 (slight modifications were made, e.g. billingual features and theming).  It provided a site that allowed users to submit applications (and ideas) to be voted and commented on.  It also featured twitter streams, account management, and some analytics.

The intention of posting this code is for others to be able to use the application as well as improve the it and provide those improvements back to the community by posting those updates here.  This code is provided as-is and with no warranties.  All references to the City of Ottawa found within the application, e.g. the "Apps4Ottawa" branding and associated word marks should be removed when publishing the site publicly.  

Note: work is currently underway to upgrade the site for future contests.  Those updates will be available here.
